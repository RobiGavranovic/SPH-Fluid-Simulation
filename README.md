# SPH-Fluid-Simulation
This simulation was created as an end project for my subject of Programming 3 at University of Primorska, Koper.
It is inspired by Mitchel Sayer's project:
https://github.com/mitchellsayer/Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics/tree/master

Mitchel's project helped me understand the mathematics behind SPH fluid simulating and definetly sped up my development process,
therefore i want to show my gratitude to Mitchel for allowing me to use his project as a reference; Thank you.
